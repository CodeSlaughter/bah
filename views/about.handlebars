                        </header>
                        <p>My name is Kendyl Auten and I am a mother of two sons. We currently reside in Central Jersey. I am
                            the youngest of seven siblings between New Jersey, Florida, and South Carolina. I have over 18
                            years of work experience with a broad industry background from hospitality, medical, moving and
                            storage, forensic engineering, manufacturing goods, industrial packaging, and food retail. I
                            enjoy spending time with family and close friends, shopping, travelling, listening to music,
                            dancing, and most importantly helping others. At a young age, I watched my Mom work two jobs
                            between babysitting during the day and her full-time job in the evening. I admired her for being
                            able to manage both jobs successfully. For a short period of time, my Mom began caring for children
                            of a close family friend. I admired her even more for caring for children other than her own.
                            In my early twenties, I started caring for my godson and taking him into my home as my own. During
                            undergrad, I interned at a residential community home for youths in Bordentown, New Jersey assisting
                            them with resumes, open group sessions, and guidance for those transitioning out as young adults.
                            During the course and after graduate school, I would assist my friends and classmates with their
                            resumes and provide advice based on my educational and work experience. Over the years of watching
                            my Mom care for children, assisting parents, working hard, and enjoy seeing the gratitude of
                            helping others, I realized this is something that my Mom and I have in common. Everyone needs
                            a hand at some point in their lives. My goal is to help as many people as I can so they can share
                            their experience and tools to help others. </p>

                            </h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>After being laid-off multiple times, I found myself bouncing around many questions and thoughts in
                            my mind. Was I a good employee? Was my work not to their standards? What could I have done better?
                            Was my continued education all for nothing? During those transitional times, it was a very stressful
                            and tough. When requesting for assistance, I felt like a number. There was no human compassion
                            in the process. I was a single parent, unemployed, and had to figure how to make ends meet. In
                            addition to being stressed, your anxiety tends to increases between applying for jobs, interviewing,
                            and wishful thinking of that dream job emailing you back to say, "We want to make you an offer."
                            In the meantime, the clock is ticking for your unemployment to run out. It just makes you want
                            to scream. </p>
                        <p>Looking on the bright side of things, this process allowed me to really utilize my resources whether
                            using my skills and knowledge, taking on courses offered through unemployment, learning to navigate
                            through several job boards, networking with others and continued to carry out my goal on helping
                            others. The reason for starting Bear-A-Hand is to bring a human touch of compassion while providing
                            a hands-on approach with individuals in transition on resumes, job searches, networking, and
                            other requested services.</p>
